# Template

`Template` serves as a template that can be used as an initial foundation for new projects. It provides best practices and a structured approach to service implementation.  

However, these best practices are not mandatory. If they do not suit the specific needs of a new project, they can be adjusted or replaced accordingly. The goal is to offer a useful starting point while allowing flexibility for project-specific requirements.
